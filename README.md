## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

Based on this I present to you the Readme Generator. An application that get user inputs and generate a professional README.md file. With Readme Generator you can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. Saving your time, you to devote more time to working on your projects.
